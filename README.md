# Readme

A playground focused on application to the engineering tasks in the everydai works.

The main goal is to speed-up and reduce the effort of implementations.

**Fields** this repo is focused on:

- `Excel`: formula, array formula, and other functionalities;
- `Excel+VBA`: automation by VBA scripting;
- `UserForm`: GUIs implementation integrating both spreadsheet and VBA functionalities.

**Contents** for each field:

- *example*: complete implementations applied to real cases, ready to use;
- *playground*: implementations for practicing;
- *documentation*: extensive dissertation of a specific topic;
- *toolbox*: quick reference (cheatsheet style) with reference tables and compact snippets.

## File Naming

Files are named by well-defined prefixes to ease the search of the requested file and the identification of the field it applies to.

| Field       | Identifier |
| ---         | ---        |
| `Excel`     | `xl`       |
| `Excel+VBA` | `vba`      |
| `UserForm`  | `uf`       |

Also filetypes have dedicated prefixes:

| Filetype                                  | Identifier |
| ---                                       | ---        |
| Document focusing on a specific topic     | `doc`      |
| Toolbox                                   | `tbx`      |
| Playground file                           | `plg`      |
| Example                                   | `ex`       |

Prefixes are built by combinating the identifiers mentioned.
